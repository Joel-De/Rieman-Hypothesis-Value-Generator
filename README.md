# Rieman-Hypothesis-Value-Generator
WARNING: Program creates several threads will lag your computer out if you want to do other things on it while running this, I've designed it so that it stores all the values in a vector before outputing them to help speed things up, so dont input very high values & accuracy levels. OR bypass this feature (should be pretty straight forward) and output to the file each itteration (Will slow you down if you are using an HDD).

Creates a map of the complex values that the Riemann Zeta function outputs for a given complex input in the critical strip

All the number are output to a text file, Have fun :)
